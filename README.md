🏈 Jira Agile Project - Fantasy Football Web App

This project demonstrates how I use Jira to plan, track, and test a web application using Agile/Scrum principles. I created this Jira project from scratch to showcase my understanding of epics, user stories, sprints, releases, and bug tracking in a realistic product development workflow.

📌 Project Overview

Goal:
Showcase real-world Agile project management and QA practices using Jira, modeled after a fantasy football web application.

Tools & Methodology:

Jira (Scrum project)

Agile / Scrum

User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

Sprint Planning & Release Management

Bug Tracking & QA Documentation

🧱 Project Structure
Epics & Feature Areas

I created epics to represent major product areas:

Roster Management

League Standings

Player Statistics

Achievements

League Navigation

User Stories & Tasks

Detailed user stories with clear, testable acceptance criteria

Stories broken down into realistic development subtasks

Labels used to categorize:

Gameplay features

League information

User account functionality

Components & Releases

Components configured to represent major UI modules:

TeamRosterView

LeagueStandingsBoard

All work linked to release versions to demonstrate incremental delivery

🐞 Bug Tracking & QA

Bugs are documented as a separate issue type and include:

Steps to reproduce

Expected vs. actual results

Severity and priority levels

Environment details (browser, OS, platform)

Several bugs focus on business logic and data consistency, not just UI issues, including:

Lineup submission allowed after deadline

Roster state not updating without a manual refresh

This highlights a QA-first mindset and attention to real-world application behavior.

🚀 Sprint Planning
Sprint 1: Core Gameplay (2 Weeks)

Sprint Goal:
Deliver a minimum playable experience where users can:

View their roster

Add or drop players

View league standings

This sprint aligns with Version 1.0: Core Gameplay, prioritizing foundational user flows before advanced features.

🔁 Agile Practices Demonstrated

Backlog grooming and prioritization

Story point estimation

Sprint planning with clear goals

Incremental release planning

QA-focused acceptance criteria and bug reporting

✅ Why This Project Matters

This project reflects how I would operate on a real Agile development team, using Jira to:

Plan and break down features

Track sprint progress

Identify and document bugs

Ensure quality throughout the development lifecycle

It is designed to demonstrate product thinking, Agile discipline, and QA awareness — not just task tracking.
