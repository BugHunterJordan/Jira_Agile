Jira Agile Project - Fantasy Football Web App
This project demonstrates how I use Jira to plan, track, and test a new web application using Agile/Scrum principles. I created this Jira project from scratch to showcase my understanding of epics, user stories, sprints, releases, and bug tracking in a realistic product workflow.
Project Structure
* Created epics to represent major product areas (Roster Management, Standings, Player Stats, Achievements, League Navigation)
* Wrote detailed user stories with clear, testable acceptance criteria
* Broke stories into subtasks to reflect real development work
* Used labels to categorize gameplay, league info, and user account features
* Configured components to represent major UI modules (TeamRosterView, LeagueStandingsBoard)
* Linked all work to release versions to show incremental delivery
Bug Tracking & QA
I documented bugs as a separate issue type with:
* Clear steps to reproduce
* Expected vs actual results
* Severity and priority levels
* Environment details (browser, OS, platform)
Several bugs demonstrate business logic and data refresh issues, not just UI problems (e.g., lineup submission after deadline, roster state not updating without refresh).
Sprint Planning
I set up a 2-week FF Sprint 1 focused on delivering a minimum playable experience.
🎯 Sprint 1 Goal
Deliver a usable core gameplay loop where a user can:
* View their roster
* Add or drop players
* View league standings
This sprint aligns with Version 1.0 - Core Gameplay and prioritizes foundational user flows before advanced features.
Agile Practices Demonstrated
* Backlog grooming and prioritization
* Story point assignment
* Sprint planning with clear goals
* Incremental release planning
* QA-focused acceptance criteria and bug reporting
This project reflects how I would use Jira on a real Agile team to plan features, track progress, and ensure quality throughout development.
