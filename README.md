## 🐞 Bug Tracking and QA

Bugs are documented as a separate issue type and include:
- Clear steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual results
- Severity and priority levels
- Environment details (browser, OS, platform)

Several bugs focus on business logic and data consistency, not just UI issues, including:
- Lineup submission allowed after deadline
- Roster state not updating without a manual refresh

This highlights a QA-first mindset and attention to real-world application behavior.
